# CliniScan

CliniScan is a layered multimodal triage workflow for symptom intake and risk assessment. It combines patient-reported symptoms, optional image input, body location, duration, severity, age, medications, known conditions, and a selected AI provider to return a structured triage summary.

The product is designed for hackathon demo use as a clinical decision-support prototype. It is not a medical device and it does not diagnose users.

## Safety Disclaimer

Every user-facing result must preserve this message:

> Not a medical diagnosis. Always consult a licensed medical professional.

CliniScan should describe results as possible conditions, risk signals, red flags, urgency level, clinical assessment, and recommended next step. Avoid language that implies a confirmed diagnosis.

## Current Capabilities

- Structured symptom intake with body location, duration, severity, age, known conditions, and medications.
- Optional image upload for visual evidence extraction.
- Provider selection between Anthropic and OpenAI.
- Deterministic evidence fusion that combines text and visual signals into a risk score.
- Conflict detection when patient-reported severity and image-based severity disagree.
- Safety override and red flag detection for urgent symptoms.
- Quality gate for uncertain or limited inputs.
- JSON-only clinical reasoning layer with safe fallback behavior.
- Demo scenarios for presentation without live API calls.
- Polished React/Vite frontend with intake, processing, and results dashboard views.

## Backend Pipeline

1. Safety override scans symptom text for urgent keywords.
2. Symptom structurer converts text fields into a structured symptom object.
3. Vision extractor converts an uploaded image into structured visual evidence when an image is provided.
4. Evidence fusion computes text score, vision score, total risk score, urgency, risk signals, and conflict status.
5. Quality gate evaluates whether the input is strong enough for confident triage support.
6. Clinical reasoning receives only structured evidence and returns possible conditions, confidence levels, assessment text, red flags, recommendation, and disclaimer.
7. JSON parser validates and normalizes model output; invalid model output falls back safely.

## AI Providers And Models

The API keys only authenticate with each provider. The model names are selected in code:

- Anthropic: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- OpenAI: `gpt-4o`

Current model constants live in `backend/layers/ai_gateway.py`.

## API Endpoints

### `GET /health`

Returns backend status, provider configuration status, and selected model names.

### `POST /analyze`

Required JSON fields:

- `symptom_text`
- `body_location`
- `duration_days`
- `severity_score`
- `provider`

Optional fields:

- `age`
- `known_conditions`
- `medications`
- `image_base64`
- `image_mime`
- `demo_scenario`

`provider` must be either `anthropic` or `openai`.

`demo_scenario` can be `1`, `2`, or `3`.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Anthropic and/or OpenAI API key

### 1. Backend Environment

From the repo root:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `backend/.env`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv ../.venv
../.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional API key smoke test:

```bash
cd backend
../.venv/bin/python check_api_keys.py
```

Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
../.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Backend URL:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Frontend Environment

In a separate terminal, from the repo root:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

If the backend is running on a different port:

```bash
cd frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001 npm run dev -- --port 3002
```

## Demo Scenarios

The frontend includes three cached demo scenarios:

- Skin Rash
- Minor Burn
- Eye Redness

Demo scenarios call the backend with `demo_scenario` and return cached responses from `backend/cache/`. They are useful for presentations because they do not require live model calls.

## Verification

Run backend tests from the repo root:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

Run the frontend production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Expected current verification:

```text
19 backend tests passing
frontend Vite build passing
```

## Known Limitations

- CliniScan is a hackathon prototype, not a clinically validated medical device.
- It does not store user history or provide authentication.
- Uploaded images are sent as base64 request payloads to the backend.
- Live analysis requires configured provider API keys.
- Model output is constrained and validated, but the system still requires clinician review.

## Team Workflow

Recommended debugging flow:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Create a branch for new work:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Before pushing:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
cd frontend
npm run build
```
